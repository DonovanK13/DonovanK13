### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Dukho Donovan Kim, and while I have a strong background in finance and business development, I have recently discovered a passion 
for data science. With more than 20 years of experience in investment banking, consumer finance, and solar power project development, I am a 
specialist in financial modeling, investment research, and data analysis.

As a CFA charterholder, my finance expertise provides a solid foundation for my training in the Jovian data science bootcamp, where I received over 
500 hours of training in Python, statistics, data analysis and visualization, machine learning, SQL, and Power BI/Tableau. Armed with these skills, 
I am eager to tackle new challenges and explore the limitless potential of data science.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ML project on predicting residential mortgage default rates
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... too many to list but mostly something to do w/ data science. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a marathoner, mountaineer, traveler... in April, you can find me Spain doing my Camino de Santiago.
